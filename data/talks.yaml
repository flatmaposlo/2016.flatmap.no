      "ROLL YOUR OWN SHAPELESS"
    abstract:
      "Shapeless is a remarkable framework. It gives us the power to represent
      astonishingly rich constraints and generalize code over very broad
      structural classes, but it isn't magic! The tools with which shapeless is
      crafted are present in your version of scalac just as much as they are in
      Miles Sabin's, and learning to take advantage of them unlocks a rich
      palette of expression otherwise untapped in the language. In this talk,
      we will recreate some of the major elements of shapeless, learning how to
      harness a fully armed and operational type system, all while avoiding any
      hint of macro programming! Particular focus will be given to understanding
      the general patterns and ideas involved, and not just the end result."

      "THE EFF MONAD, ONE MONAD TO RULE THEM ALL"
    abstract:
      "<p>
      Monad transformers are a neat way to compose effectul computations:
      pass some configuration, read/write from disk, track errors...
      However they can be a bit cumbersome to deal with, especially if you
      want to use different stacks sharing some common effects:
      for example a stack to interact with AWS and another one for Hadoop
      computations.
      </p>

      <p>
      This talk will shortly introduce monad transformers in Scala and their
      drawbacks then present the Eff monad.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Eff monad has some really interesting properties:

      <ul>
        <li>
          effects can be developed completely independently from each other
        </li>
        <li>
          effects can be interpreted in different ways and the interpreters
          can be composed together
        </li>
        <li>
          it is based on an efficient \"Free monad\"
          (avoiding the issue of quadratic flatMaps)
        </li>
        <li>
          with the Eff monad you will never have to re-implement the Monad
          operations (point / flatMap) again!
        </li>
      </ul>

      In this talk we will briefly introduce you to the basics of Akka and
      Docker and then show how you can use these innovative technologies to
      build and run really Reactive micorservices.

      "INFINITE LAMBDA CALCULUS"
    abstract:
      "<p>
      Last year, on flatMap(Oslo): Jonas and Einar found that they could write
      safe programs if they employed big lambdas (types) to watch over the
      small lambdas (expressions), in a typed lambda calculus. That way, the
      small lambdas wouldn't form terms that would run off to compute forever.
      </p>
      <p>
      This year, on flatMap(Oslo): Jonas and Einar return to investigate the
      nature of such renegade terms. Are they any good? Can we do something
      useful with them? And, more importantly, can we do something useless?
      Join Jonas and Einar as they boldly go where types say no!

      "HOW TO TEST proper{t,l}y"
    abstract:
      "<p>
      Writing unit tests is pretty much established practice and in addition
      to that, property testing has caught up on popularity. Most functional
      languages have one, sometimes even many implementations. But \"property
      testing\" has a lot of aspects: randomized or exhaustive, minimization
      and generalization of counter examples, custom generators and filters,
      to name a few. Very often, property tests don't exploit all the features
      of the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this talk, I'll give an overview of the state of the art of property
      testing in $X and show some common use cases, techniques and pitfalls.

    abstract:
      "<p>Product types and coproduct types are ubiquitous in functional
      programming. In fact, it would be pretty challenging to program without
      them! In this talk, we will consider examples of products and coproducts
      and then discuss how we can view them as category theory constructs.
      </p>
      <p>
      We will then generalize our understanding of these types, defining them
      abstractly in terms of the limit and colimit.
      </p>
      <p>
      From there, we will explore other examples of limits in functional
      programming to see what surprises they uncover.
